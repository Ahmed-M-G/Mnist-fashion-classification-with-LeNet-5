# Mnist fashion classification with LeNet-5

 ## Data Preparation
  -	In this project we will use LeNet architecture to classify Mnist dataset then transfer learning by using Vgg16 and ResNet models and compare each score of them.
  - In this exercise you need to implement a LeNet-5 network to recognize the FashionMNIST digits.
    * Modify hyperparameters to get to the best performance you can achieve.
    * Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
    * In the report, provide a plot of accuracy improvement using the previously mentioned techniques. Also plot the convergence curve for LeNet-5.
    * Comment on why you think LeNet-5 further improves the accuracy if any at all. And if it doesn't, why not?
    * Note that this is an open-ended problem. So, there could be very good solutions.
    * Try to use other two CNN models (using transfer learning) and compare the results with the full trained LeNet-5.
